/// Builds the RealityKit representation for a `TwinfoldAsset`, dispatching
/// on `asset.spatialRepresentation`:
///
/// - `.card` renders the existing `AssetCardEntity` (flat image card).
/// - `.model` loads a real-world-scale USDZ twin — `scale` is left at its
///   default (1), so an Object Capture export placed next to the physical
///   item reads as true-to-size — and tags it with a
///   `GroundingShadowComponent` so it casts a contact shadow like the real
///   object beside it.
///
/// USDZ scans are not part of this repo yet (no rights-cleared scan
/// exists). Drop one at
/// `packages/TwinfoldCore/Sources/TwinfoldCore/Resources/models/<resource>`
/// — the whole `Resources/models` directory is already declared as a
/// package resource in `Package.swift` (currently holding only a
/// `.gitkeep` placeholder) — with a filename matching
/// `spatialRepresentation.resource` in `fixtures/demo/assets.json` (e.g.
/// `kokeshi_demo.usdz`). Until a matching file exists, `make(asset:)` falls
/// back to `AssetCardEntity.makeThinPlate(asset:)` — a single thin image
/// plane with no backing box, using the fixture's `display.imageUrl` PNG —
/// and logs why.
///
/// Both branches tag the returned root `Entity.name` as
/// `AssetCardEntity.entityName`, so callers that find "the placed asset
/// entity" by name (`ARSceneController.handleTap`,
/// `GalleryModel.handleTap`) keep working regardless of which
/// representation was actually built.
